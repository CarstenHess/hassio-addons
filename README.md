# hassio-addons

Repository for hass.io addons.

## [Rpi RF Receiver]

RF Receiver Addon -- cloned from Pentomax' original repo: https://github.com/pantomax/hassio-addons
This clone drops python2 support, and cleans up dependencies to support the newer Alpine images (and thus work in newer Home Assistant installations) 

## nexus433

Addon-wrapper for the nexus433 application that receives and decodes data from temperature sensors transmitting on 433MHz radio, and transmits it to MQTT.
