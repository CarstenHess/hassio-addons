# Broadlink S1C Addon

This addon is for the Broadlink S1C Alarm System

1. Install the addon.

2. Copy "broadlink.py" and "s1c.py" in the "share" share of your hass.io.

3. Edit "s1c.py" adding your mosquitto address, port, user and  password. Then add your S1C IP Address and Mac Address.

4. Start the addon (it takes also 10 minutes to start, don't worry) and eventually reboot the hass.io if the addon starts giving you strange readings.
